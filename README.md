Mura JS & Vue (client-side example)

These is the code example modules for the "Mura & Vue.js: A Love Story" Webinar & talk, but rewritten to use the standard "client-side" format that we now use as standard.

Note that *Mura 7.1+ is required* for these examples to work.

To test these examples:

1) enable "Mura ORM Scaffolding" in the Site Settings > Edit Site > Modueles section of the Mura administrator
2) deploy the "BlogMuraJSVue" folder inside the root /modules directory
3) reload your Mura instance using ?appreload&applydbupdates to initialize the modules and set up the required "officelocation" Mura ORM object
4) use "Inline Editing" on a blank page in your Mura site and drop the module into the main body of the page

Note that you can manage (add/modify/delete) the data used by this example by going to the Content > Custom tab in your Mura adminstrator and clicking on the "Office Location" custom object.
